## How to Access the Webpage Locally

If you prefer to access the webpage locally, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Project Files**: First, download all the project files, including `index.html` and `style.css`. You have to download them individually.   
2. **Locate the Files on Your Computer**: Place all the downloaded files in a folder on your computer where you'd like to access the webpage locally.   
3. **Open the HTML File**: To view the webpage, simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser. Double-clicking on the `index.html` file should automatically open it in your default browser. If it doesn't, you can right-click on the file, choose "Open with," and select your desired browser from the list.
